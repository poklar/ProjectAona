version: 0.1.5

I can now build walls and remove objects.

ToDo:
* Spawn a sprite that is able to build walls/remove objects
  - That means I have to build in some sort of job system
* That sprite should avoid obstacles

version: 0.1.3

I'm now able to create walls that are linked to each other. And I'm using a texture atlas for the cave tiles.
When I'm fullscreen, the game uses about 25% of the CPU. I will have to look into that.

FIXED:
* Terrain textures flickering

ToDo:
* Create a build mode where I can select tiles and put down walls
* Read more on game structure

ToDo:

* Read more on game structure

* Look into texture atlas

version: 0.1.1

I'm able to create "random" generated terrain by using Simplex noise. It uses only colors for now. I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly though. But it works for now. 

ToDo:
- Fix zoom camera.
- Figure out a system for the tile to know if it's occupied by something (tree, mineral, etc) and how to find that item, should the tile know it has an object on top of it? Questions.
- Replace the colors with textures.

Chunk creation works now.

ToDo:
- Get my hands dirty with procedural generation for my tiles. This will take a while since I'm completly new to this.
